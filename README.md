### Hi there! 😁👋🏻

My name is Eleazar Maestre, I'm Full-Stack Software Engineer from Venezuela 🇻🇪. I've been working for more than 3 years and I'm very happy to work in this wonderful branch of computer science 💻. 

I love to use JavaScript, especially React JS for the Front-end and Express.js for the Back-end, also I'm a big fan of Python and Flask 🐍.

I'm a soccer fan ⚽️ (Chelsea FC 🔵), also I love to watch TV series, movies 🍿, and the varied music 🎶
